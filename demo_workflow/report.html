<td>An instance with unencrypted block device refers to a situation where data at rest in the storage attached to your instance is not encrypted. This poses a potential security risk as unauthorized users may access sensitive data stored in the block storage. To address this issue, it is recommended that all forms of data at rest, including block storage, be encrypted using appropriate security protocols. In particular, for the AWS EBS block storage, encryption should be turned on upon creation. This can be accomplished through Terraform by setting the "encrypted" argument to true while defining each AWS EBS volume. For pre-existing unencrypted volumes, one option would be to create a snapshot, copy it with encryption enabled, then replace the unencrypted volumes with the encrypted ones.</td>

In the present configuration, session tokens for IMDS, a service that provides temporary AWS credentials, are not activated. This activation is essential because it significantly restricts potential attackers' attempts to access temporary credentials to impersonate permissioned instances. To resolve this, it's recommended that IMDSv2, the latest version of IMDS, be utilized as it mandates session tokens, providing superior protection. This can be achieved by configuring the 'metadata_options' block in the 'aws_instance' resource, setting 'http_tokens' to 'required' and 'http_put_response_hop_limit' to '1â€™.</td>

<td>Unencrypted S3 bucket.</td>
<td>HIGH</td>
<td>An unencrypted S3 bucket is a serious security issue as it means any data stored within the bucket is not protected and can be accessed or manipulated if compromised. This vulnerability can lead to loss or theft of sensitive information or data breaches. To remediate this, you need to encrypt the S3 bucket by implementing AWS S3 server-side encryption (SSE). This process encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Specifically, you should use SSE-S3 which uses AWS S3 managed keys or SSE-KMS which uses AWS Key Management Service, automated and generally recommended for better audit trails. Make sure to update your Terraform script to reflect these changes.</td>

<td>The issue 'S3 Access Block should Ignore Public Acl' refers to the access control settings whereby the Amazon S3 buckets or objects therein are accessible to the public. Public access is a high-severity security risk as it could lead to unauthorized access or even data loss. The recommended resolution would involve setting the 'Ignore Public Acl' attribute to 'true' within the 'aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block' resource in your Terraform configuration. This setting ensures that Amazon S3 ignores all public Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the bucket, effectively blocking public access and enhancing the security of your infrastructure.</td>

<td>S3 Buckets not publicly accessible through ACL.</td>
<td>HIGH</td>
<td>The aforementioned high-severity issue indicates that your S3 buckets in AWS have been configured with access control lists (ACLs) that bar public accessibility. This means that individuals or services without specific permissions may be unable to access the data stored within these S3 buckets. Consequently, this might disrupt operations that necessitate public accessibility. To rectify this issue, you must adjust your bucket policy or ACL settings in AWS. However, it is critical to ensure controlled and secure access to avoid unintentional data exposure. Rather than making all buckets publicly accessible, consider employing signed URLs or presigned URLs which offer secure temporary access. AWS IAM roles should also be used to manage permissions efficiently. Alternatively, use Amazon CloudFront as a secure and efficient way to distribute your data to consumers.</td>

<td>The high severity issue referred to within the Terraform configuration revolves around an S3 bucket in AWS that does not have proper access restrictions, potentially enabling public access. This is a critical security concern as it can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of data or unintended data leaks. To mitigate this issue, it's recommended to modify the S3 bucket policy or use the bucket's Public Access Block configuration to explicitly deny any public access. There needs to be a rigorous setup of IAM policies, adhering to the principle of least privilege to ensure only essential access is granted. Additionally, enabling logging and versioning mechanisms would help track changes and maintain data integrity.</td>

<td>The high-severity issue 'Ensure Instance Metadata Service Version 1 is not enabled' within the Terraform framework raises a significant security concern. This is due to the potential for unauthorized access to sensitive data by exploiting the flaws in Instance Metadata Service Version 1. This version lacks adequate security protections, making it feasible for an attacker to intercept or modify the instance metadata, thereby gaining illegitimate access to secure data. The recommended resolution subsists in disabling version 1 and shifting to use Instance Metadata Service Version 2, which has been equipped with effective measures to restrict unauthorized access, such as mandatory session-oriented requests. This change can be implemented by setting the metadata options block parameter 'http_tokens' to 'required' in the AWS launch template within the Terraform code.</td>

An EBS-optimized instance provides dedicated bandwidth between Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS, which improves the communication flow and enhances I/O performance. To resolve the issue, all Amazon EC2 instances should be deployed as EBS-optimized to benefit from dedicated capacity for Amazon EBS I/O. This can be done by selecting the 'EBS optimized instance' option during the EC2 instance creation process or modifying the attribute of an existing EC2 instance to enable EBS optimization.</td>

An AWS S3 bucket without event notifications may lead to undiscovered unauthorized access or changes to the bucket content, escalating security risks. Therefore, as a recommended resolution, implementing AWS S3 bucket notifications is vital. Enable event notifications, preferably using AWS Lambda or Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), so that every event such as put, post, copy, delete, or restore of any object triggers a notification. This way, you will maintain control and better visibility over the access and activities concerning your S3 buckets.</td>

Cross-region replication in AWS S3 permits automatic, asynchronous replication of objects across buckets in different AWS Regions, thus bolstering data availability and serving as a safeguard against region-level failures. To remedy this issue, it is advised that you enable cross-region replication in your S3 bucket settings, and ensure that your Terraform scripts correctly deploy this setting for all current and future S3 buckets, per AWS's best practices recommendations. Guaranteeing this setting is in place will significantly enhance your organization's data protection and disaster recovery capabilities.</td>

<td>S3 Bucket has an ACL defined which allows public READ access.</td>
<td>HIGH</td>
<td>The identified high-severity issue within the terraform framework relates to the improper access control list (ACL) configuration of an S3 bucket, permitting public READ access. This means that anyone on the internet can potentially read the data within the bucket, leading to unwanted exposure of sensitive information. To address this, modify the ACL policy on S3 to disallow public access, effectively restricting READ permissions to only designated and authenticated users or services. Implementing additional security measures like bucket policies and IAM policies for stringent access control and encryption for stored data can further reinforce data security and confidentiality. Furthermore, regular audits and review of the access policy will help in ensuring the security of your S3 resources.</td>

<td>Ensure that S3 buckets are encrypted with KMS by default</td>
<td>HIGH</td>
<td>The issue refers to inadequate security in AWS S3 data storage, where sensitive data may be at risk due to the absence of a default encryption using Key Management Service (KMS). Encryption provides an additional security layer by transforming data into an unreadable format without an encryption key which makes it difficult for unauthorized persons to access. To mitigate this high-severity exposure, every created S3 bucket should be encrypted using KMS keys by default. This can be enforced by updating Terraform scripts to include a bucket encryption configuration block using aws_kms_key resource. Maintaining consistent use of encryption makes sure the data stored in S3 buckets is always protected, strengthening the overall security posture of the infrastructure.</td>

<td>Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket have versioning enabled</td>
<td>HIGH</td>
<td>This security issue pertains to the lack of versioning for data stored in the S3 bucket, which refers to a setting on Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) that preserves, retrieves, and restores every version of every object in a bucket. This issue can cause serious problems if data is unintentionally deleted or overwritten, as it doesn't allow recovery of previous versions. To solve this, one must enable versioning on S3 buckets as a best practice. This can be done through the AWS Management console, AWS CLI, or SDKs by altering the bucket policy accordingly. This capability not only allows you to recover previous versions of your data but also provides an extra layer of protection for your application data hosted on S3.</td>

<td>This high-severity issue pertains to the insecure configuration of an EC2 instance in the Terraform framework, detached from an IAM role, thus lacking specific permissions that govern the service or user demands. AWS EC2 instances should have an IAM role attached to securely manage access to services and resources. To resolve this, ensure to assign an IAM role that contains the necessary permissions upon the creation of each AWS EC2 instance when writing the Terraform code. This will help in managing precise and secured access to AWS services and resources for your EC2 instances, thereby elevating the security configuration.</td>

<td>MEDIUM</td>
<td>This high-severity issue pertains to the absence of a lifecycle configuration for an S3 bucket in a Terraform setup. A lifecycle configuration is a vital aspect of AWS services, specifically S3. Without it, unnecessary or outdated objects can be retained indefinitely, leading to uncontrolled growth of stored objects, thereby increasing storage costs and potentially exacerbating the risk of a data breach. To rectify this issue, you should define a lifecycle policy within your Terraform script that timely manages object retention and deletion. Implementing this policy will ensure that old and unnecessary data is automatically deleted or shifted to more cost-effective storage classes after a specified period, providing both better data management and cost-efficiency.</td>
