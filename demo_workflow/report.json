It is strongly advised that Public Access Block configurations are enabled on all S3 buckets to stop public access from being granted, both deliberately and inadvertently. To resolve this, enforce account-level and bucket-level settings to restrict public access either through the AWS management console or with the 'aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block' resource in your Terraform configuration, ensuring block_public_acls, block_public_policy, ignore_public_acls, and restrict_public_buckets attributes are set as 'true'.",

This issue can compromise resource management and may lead to unnecessary costs or potential data unavailability. The recommended fix is to enforce a lifecycle policy on all S3 buckets to automatically handle object transition or expiration.
