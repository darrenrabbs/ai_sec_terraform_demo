This feature maintains a record of all access requests and events for your S3 bucket, serving as a vital tool for security and auditing procedures and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. To address this risk, enable access logging in your S3 bucket through the AWS management console or Terraform code directly. In the Terraform code, include the \"logging\" block in your \"aws_s3_bucket\" resource ensuring the target bucket (where logs are stored) is defined. This action fortifies your bucket's security by tracking user activities and access patterns enhancing anomaly detection and incident response.",

Not setting secure encryption as a default poses a serious risk to data security, making the S3 buckets vulnerable to unauthorized data access. To address this, it is recommended to use KMS encryption by default for all S3 buckets. You can accomplish this by configuring the 'server_side_encryption_configuration' block in the 'aws_s3_bucket' resource, setting its 'sse_algorithm' to 'aws:kms'.

As a resolution, it is suggested to set up a lifecycle rule in your S3 bucket settings to manage objects efficiently. The configuration should include actions like transitioning objects to lower-cost storage classes at certain periods or setting up an expiration action to delete objects after a defined time. This ensures efficient utilization of resources thereby optimizing cost, and maintains the security of data by timely removal of unwanted/unused data.",
